# üë§ Task Manager API üìù
This is a fully functioning REST API written in Node.js, powered by Express and MongoDB.

## Features
- This API allows users to:
  - Create an account using a unique email
  - Login and logout with passwords 
  - Perform CRUD operations for task objects which include a description and a boolean representing whether the task has been completed or not
  - Customize their account further by uploading a profile picture
  - Recieve emails upon creation and deletion of their account  

## How it Works
-	Developing a back end for the application using Node, Express, and MongoDB.
-	Creating user models and variables by implementing schemas in Mongoose. 
-	Giving the user‚Äôs ability to log in and log out with authentication through successfully implementing hashed passwords and JWT tokens.
-	Allowing users to create, read, update, and delete posts through the help of Express.
-	Sending custom emails when a user deletes/creates an account and allowing users to upload profile pictures through various NPM modules. 
-	Testing all requests through Postman and using MongoDB Compass to host the API/database.
