# 👤 Task Manager API 📝

## Features

## How it Works
-	Developing a back end for the application using Node, Express, and MongoDB
-	Creating user models and variables by implementing schemas in Mongoose. Giving the user’s ability to log in and log out with authentication through successfully implementing hashed passwords and JWT tokens
-	Allowing users to create, read, update, and delete posts through the help of Express
-	Sending custom emails when a user deletes/creates an account and allowing users to upload profile pictures through various NPM modules. Testing all requests through Postman and using MongoDB Compass to host the API/database
